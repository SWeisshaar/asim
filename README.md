# ASIM - Project on Stock Trading
The goal of this project is to implement a genetic algorithm, that finds a near optimal combination of technical trading indicators.

## Data
We use price histories of stocks taken from the S&P 500.

## Based on
This project is build on top of the basic implementation for a [genetic algorithm](https://machinelearningmastery.com/simple-genetic-algorithm-from-scratch-in-python/) from Jason Brownlee, as well as the [ta python package](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) implementing different indicators for technical analysis ([article](https://towardsdatascience.com/technical-analysis-library-to-financial-datasets-with-pandas-python-4b2b390d3543) regarding the technical analysis library).
